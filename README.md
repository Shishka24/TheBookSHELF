# TheBookSHELF
Final Project/ Concordia Bootcamp 
For my website, I was using the API: The book database (https://rapidapi.com/roftcomp-laGmBwlWLm/api/hapi-books/)
The main ide of the website is to explore books
When you get to the main page, you will see the weekly popular genres.
You can find the books you want by using the search bar, with the description of the book.
For those people who would like to leave comments, you can login if you have an account, or register if you do not.
To create an account, you can follow the steps, the website will notify you of any mistakes.
Your account and information will be send to MongoDB and your password will be encrypted.
Now you can go and login on the main page, see comments by other users and leave your own comments.
You also have a profile page, that contains your personal information.
